* Touchbistro was incorporated in 2010

* The company was founded by Alex Barrotti and Geordie Konrad

* TouchBistro is a mobile iPad POS and integrated payment system that helps restauranteurs put more money back in their pockets and more time back in their day. The company has humble beginnings as Alex Barrotti conceived the concept while sitting on the patio of his friendâ€™s restaurant in the Caribbean back in 2010.

His friend was frustrated about the inconvenience of taking orders from customers on the patio and having to bring the order slips and payments inside for processing. A born innovator, Barrotti thought that mobile technology could be used to solve the issue, but no such solution existed.

* The company is funded by various Vemture capital companies like Omers, Kensington Capital Marks and financial institutions like JP Morgan Chase.

## Business Activities:

* The main financial problem the company is trying to resolve is to have an intergrated system in the food serives industry which will help resturants manage their finances including inventory, payroll and POS (Point of Sales) at the floor level.

* The main customers for the Touchbistro is the food and resturant services industry who regulary deals with various issues including inventory managament, payroll and table management.

* The companies are using the cloud technology in order to make the data readily available to all of the users and decisions can be done at any time.

## Landscape:

* Payments/Billing

* In the long term perspective, this domain will be futher developed where all of the payments that we process and recieve are going to be dominated by Electronic Payments and we will elimination of some of the Banking Process that we have today for example further elimination of Branches, small companies paying employees by check also manual inventory and accounting system

* Some of the other competitors who are in the same industry are Tacit, Soundpays, Buckzy amongst others.

* The few of the key data that companies in this domain looks for in order to see how far they have penetrated in this field.

* The company is still the leader in the industry as it was one of the first companies in the domain to provide such solutions for the business both big and small.

## Recommendations

* If I had a recommendation for this payment system, I would ask them to intergrate more online payment platform like Paypal and Google Pay because if those system are inserted into this Product they will be able to process many methods of payment outside the common banking sector or cards

* This product will not only benefit the business but it will also assist the business's client to process different ways of payment outside the cards and cash realm as it currently exist.

* Making payments and making records fully automated in order to avoid errors and mistakes which can impact the businesses of today and in the future
